This a very simple demo of [Spring Boot](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)

[gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) is the build tool

[Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html) is the templating framework

####Run

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

The first run may take a while, downloading dependencies etc, subsequent runs should only take a few seconds
